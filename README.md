Want a local development environment for https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner ?

1. install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org
2. install Vagrant from https://www.vagrantup.com
3. clone this project from, well, here
4. run `vagrant up` and get a cup of coffee
5. point a web browser or two at http://localhost:1042/

Some key Vagrant commands: `up`, `ssh`, `halt`, and `destroy`.

The running code will be in '/home/netrunner' inside the VM. Be careful with `destroy`!
